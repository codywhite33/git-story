There once was a nomad dog.
He lived on the streets of Hawaii and lived off of food scraps people left around.
He loved running on the beach and swimming in the water. 
Many citizens in Honolulu knew this dog, and would recognize him. 
He remained nameless for a many years. 
One day he found a homeless guitar player and cuddled up to him.
